Platformer game demo on SpriteKit and Swift for iOS and macOS. Jump and collect the coins. It’s the demo version so you can’t lose in it.   
The main features are:  
- endless scrolling with 3-layers background simulating parallax, implemented in the ScrollingBackground class. Each layer is a separate node with its own velocity. New layers could be easily added.   
- platforms randomizer. Platforms are created endlessly. This feature is implemented in Platforms generator class and could be easily modified if needed.
